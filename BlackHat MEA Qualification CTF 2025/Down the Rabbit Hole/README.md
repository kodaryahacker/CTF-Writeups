## 🐰 Down the Rabbit Hole

1. We got a big scary Python file.
It had a function called check(text) that says True only if the text = flag.

2. The file hides the flag by chopping it into tiny pieces with many confusing functions.
But inside, there’s a helper called _rebuild_expected_bytes().
👉 This function secretly puts the flag back together.

3. Trick: Instead of reading all the confusing code, we just run that helper.
It gives us the hidden flag in bytes.

4. Convert bytes → text → ✅ flag is revealed.

💡 Simple lesson:
When a program checks your answer, don’t fight it.
Just ask the program: “What answer are you expecting?”
